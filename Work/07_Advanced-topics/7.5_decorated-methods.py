This section discusses a few built-in decorators that are used in combination with method definitions.

predefined decorators
There are predefined decorators used to specify special kinds of methods in class definitions.

class Foo:
    def bar(self,a):
        ...

    @staticmethod
    def spam(a):
        ...

    @classmethod
    def grok(cls,a):
        ...

    @property
    def name(self):
        ...

# 1 static methods
# @staticmethod is used to define a so-called static class methods (from C++/Java). 
# A static method is a function that is part of the class, but which does not operate on instances.

class Foo(object):
    @staticmethod
    def bar(x):
        print('x = ', x)
        
Foo.bar(1)

# Static methods are sometimes used to implement internal supporting code for a class. 
# For example, code to help manage created instances (memory management, system resources, persistence, locking, etc). 
# Theyâ€™re also used by certain design patterns (not discussed here).

# 2 class methods
# @classmethod is used to define class methods. 
# A class method is a method that receives the class object as the first parameter instead of the instance.

class Foo:
    def bar(self):
        print(self)
    
    @classmethod
    def spam(cls):
        print(cls)
        
f = Foo()
f.bar()  # the instance f
Foo.spam()  # the class Foo

# Class methods are most often used as a tool for defining alternate constructors.
