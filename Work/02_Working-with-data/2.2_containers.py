Programs often have to work with many objects:

- A portfolio of stocks
- A table of stock prices

There are three main choices to use:

- Lists. Ordered data.
- Dictionaries. Unordered data.
- Sets. Unordered collection of unique items.

# Use a list when the order of the data matters.

# Almost any type of value can be used as a dictionary key in Python. 
# A dictionary key must be of a type that is immutable.
# Neither a list, a set, nor another dictionary can serve as a dictionary key, 
# because lists and dictionaries are mutable.
